September 2015 - Talented Student Programme Research Component

Programme Scaffold was designed and initially created via Psychopy experiment builder(v1.82.01)
Restructured sequence flow and modified specific stimuli to fine tune experimental display parameters 
based on literature recommendations and best practices


Tested and verified effect of forward and backwards visual masking of similar visual spatial frequency 
Tested and verified presence of RB effect with repetition as experimental baseline
RSVP frame rate was iteratively calibrated with a sample of pilot participants prior to research testing
